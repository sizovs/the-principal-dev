# The Principal Developer

A principal developer is a position that requires competencies that no longer apply to only technical prowess. For an developer to get to the Principal Developer level, there needs to be cross organizational collaborative signals, there needs to be a clear understanding of architecture and design decisions that go far beyond the immediate technical area of expertise.

The role is far less about solving intricate technology problems (although there is that too) and more about being a good influence. You now carry a larger impact on morale, organization culture and even on recruiting and representing your organization outside of the company. Behaviours you display, either at the office or at tech events, are now a display of the behaviours your company rewards. Your behavior is a signal to anyone who may consider working in your organization of whether we align in values or not.

A great principal developer is:

## A polymath

A principal developer has a deep expertise in one or more technical areas, but also has the ability to collaborate across disciplines with experts in areas of expertise other than one's own. The list may include, but is not limited to system operations, quality assurance, security, product development, human resources, marketing.

## A mentor

A principal developer actively develops his team by advocating for best practices and helping the less experienced colleagues find ways to 'level up'. This includes not only engineers, but also product owners, upper management and stakeholders. He is an inspiring role model others want to follow, because he leads by example. 

## A diplomatic communicator

A principal developer has a well-developed communication skills. He knows how to professionally deal with different personalities, influence people, negotiate, manage up and down. He is ready to raise uncomfortable questions and push-back when necessary.

## A business partner

A principal developer thinks like a business person. He understands that software is only a fraction of the business, and contributes to areas where he can make the maximum impact. The areas vary from mentoring the organization on agile menthodologies, to recruiting and representing your organization outside of the company.

## A lean thinker

A principal developer understands the whole product development pipeline from concept to cash. He continuously accelerates the delivery process by elimating bottlenecks and waste. To keep the delivery fast and predictable over time, he makes sure that the team delivers at a constant, sustainable pace and has rigid quality standards.
